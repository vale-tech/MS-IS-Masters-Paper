# MS-IS-Masters-Paper
The paper I wrote to complete my MSIS at University of Nevada, Reno. I used Visual Studio along with R Tools for Visual Studio to write the markdown and associated R code. Unfortunately, I had not discovered the tidyverse at the time so my R code is a bit messy. 

The tools and document generation process were as much of a learning experience as the content of the paper. I think it turned out rather well!

## Abstract

Information technology is being heavily utilized in the healthcare industry to reduce the rate of medical errors
that may occur during delivery of care. Medical errors are currently measured using a variety of Patient
Safety and Hospital Acquired Condition metrics. These metrics can be employed to compare the quality
of care delivered by hospitals and by government agencies to provide payment incentives. This research
determines the impact of an IT strategic goal that is committed to reduce medical errors on several commonly
used metrics and finds little to no effect on the metric scores obtained.
